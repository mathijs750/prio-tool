## 2024-05-18 - Icon-Only Button Accessibility
**Learning:** Found several icon-only buttons across `TaskList` and `AddTaskModal` that relied solely on `title` attributes. Adding `aria-label` along with `aria-hidden="true"` on the internal icon elements (`<span class="material-icons">`) is critical for screen reader users to understand the button's purpose without hearing the raw ligature text (like "timer" or "check_circle"). Additionally, toggleable priority/size buttons benefit from `aria-pressed` to indicate their current state.
**Action:** Always ensure icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label` attributes and that the actual icon text/ligature is hidden from screen readers using `aria-hidden="true"`. Use `aria-pressed` for toggle states.

## 2024-05-14 - Mobile Keyboard Accessibility
**Learning:** Found that the QuickAdd component relied on an `onKeyDown` listener for the Enter key to submit tasks. This can be problematic on mobile devices where virtual keyboards might not reliably trigger the 'Enter' keydown event. Wrapping the input in a `<form>` with an `onSubmit` handler provides native, robust cross-device support for form submission, particularly for mobile users.
**Action:** Always wrap text inputs intended for submission in `<form>` elements with an `onSubmit` handler rather than relying solely on keyboard event listeners.

## 2026-05-27 - Inline Validation Errors
**Learning:** Found a native `alert()` being used to validate form submission in the AddTaskModal. Native alerts are disruptive, lose the user's context, and provide a poor experience for screen reader users compared to inline ARIA alerts.
**Action:** Prefer inline error states with `role="alert"` over native `alert()` when validating form submissions to prevent disruptive behavior and maintain accessibility context.
